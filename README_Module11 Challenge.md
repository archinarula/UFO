# Written Analysis of the UFO Sighting with Javascript challenge Module 11

## Overview of Analysis
Create a dynamic web application with Javascript that will accept user inputs on various filter criterias (city, state, country, shape and date) to display the appropriate filtered data rows on the UFO sightings information table on the HTML page. 

Data Source: 
![UFO dataset](https://github.com/archinarula/UFO/blob/main/static/js/data.js)


## Deliverable/Results: This analysis consists of one technical analysis deliverables and this written report:

Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple Criteria

Deliverable 2: A written report on UFO analysis
<add link>

## Results

The web app looks like below:

## Summary
1. On drawback of this web page is that the filters are open text fields so the user needs to type exactly how the column text is to get results. They need to first scroll through table rows to pick the filter text and then use it on respective column. If the dataset is multiple pages, this may be a challenge for usability.

2. Few recommendations for further development
- The filter criteria fields should be drop-downs with all options automatically available for users to select
- The Data table can have page numbers to display 10-20 rows at a time so user doesnt have to scroll and also for it to accomadate bigger datasets
- To reset the fields user has to refresh the data all the time. Instead there should be a reset button to clean up selections
